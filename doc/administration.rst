.. note:: XXX: needs writing

- Add registered new users regularly to the "Editor" or "Reviewer" groups
  to allow them to write + review. (Newly registered users are not able
  to edit anything, by default.)

- Pull docstrings from version control regularly and merge any conflicts
  (or leave merging to users)

- Generate patches and put the docs back to version control

- Fix any bugs in Pydocweb you find during this :)
