Short term
----------
- How do we know when we need to add new entries to numpy.add_newdocs?

Longer term
-----------
- Fetch author information from Moin history.
- Fetch multiple page revisions from Moin history on moin-collect-local,
  and figure out how to pass it on to bzr.
- Maybe we want to get docstrings via an AST parser to avoid?
