Short term
==========

  * Respect module::, currentmodule:: and automodule:: in reference resolution.

  * Make Sphinx cross-reference titles to work.

  * Make Sphinx cross-references to function:: etc. to work if they are only
    specified in the Sphinx docs.

  * List members etc. properly in auto*:: directives

  * "Next" and "Previous" buttons for easily browsing docstrings with the
    same preview state.

  * Working plot directive? Merge the sandbox branch?

  * Better documentation.

  * Fix the "Source location for %s known, but failed to find a place for the docstring"
    errors in pydoc-tool.py; appeared to occur in:

        ERROR: Source location for numpy.lib.function_base.iterable known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.bytes known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.dirichlet known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.multinomial known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.permutation known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.shuffle known, but failed to find a place for the docstring

    So, mostly Pyrex bugs?


Longer term
===========

  * Refactor: The database structure needs refactoring. The following issues
    should be fixed:

        - Review status should be in a separate table, so that we would
          have history about who did what and when.

        - SVN docstrings perhaps should be kept in the DocstringRevision
          table; this would simplify several parts of the code that work
          with SQL.

  * Refactor: views.py has grown too long and messy; ditto for models.py

  * ..image:: directive

  * Support running plot scripts & capturing output images.

  * Fix Recent changes to show only "recent" changes
    (+ browse old changes?)

  * Sandboxing Python so that doctests producing images can be run?

  * Better merging? RCS `merge` is not so intelligent when BASE and MINE
    differ much from each other, but MINE and OTHER are quite similar.

  * Can something be done about stuff whose docstring location is not known at all?
