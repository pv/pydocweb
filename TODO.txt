Short term:

  * "Next" and "Previous" buttons for easily browsing docstrings with the
    same preview state.
  * Plot directive? Merge the sandbox branch?

Longer term:

  * Refactor: views.py has grown too long and messy; ditto for models.py

  * ..image:: directive
  * Support running plot scripts & capturing output images.
  * Fix Recent changes to show only "recent" changes
    (+ browse old changes?)
  * Sandboxing Python so that doctests producing images can be run?
