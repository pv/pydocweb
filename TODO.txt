Short term
----------
- How do we know when we need to add new entries to numpy.add_newdocs?

- Now when inserting docstrings, we only handle the cases where
  1) There is a docstring that is enveloped in """
  2) There is no docstring, but there is a line ending with ':'
     and the docstring should be inserted on the line following that

- Test, test, and test.

- When ready, run numpy_fromwiki.py periodically so that wiki changes get recorded.

- Put the wiki to /wiki instead of /mywiki


Longer term
-----------
- Fetch author information from Moin history.
- Fetch multiple page revisions from Moin history on moin-collect-local,
  and figure out how to pass it on to bzr.
- Maybe we want to get docstrings via an AST parser to avoid?
