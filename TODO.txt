Short term
==========

  * "Next" and "Previous" buttons for easily browsing docstrings with the
    same preview state.

  * Plot directive? Merge the sandbox branch?

  * Better documentation.

  * Fix the "Source location for %s known, but failed to find a place for the docstring"
    errors in pydoc-tool.py; appeared to occur in:

        ERROR: Source location for numpy.lib.function_base.iterable known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.bytes known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.dirichlet known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.multinomial known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.permutation known, but failed to find a place for the docstring
        ERROR: Source location for numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState.shuffle known, but failed to find a place for the docstring

    So, mostly Pyrex bugs?


Longer term
===========

  * Refactor: The database structure needs refactoring. The following issues
    should be fixed:

        - Review status should be in a separate table, so that we would
          have history about who did what and when.

        - SVN docstrings perhaps should be kept in the DocstringRevision
          table; this would simplify several parts of the code that work
          with SQL.

        - When a first revision is made, we probably should create
          also a "base" revision that contains the version that was in SVN
          at that time. This would enable constructing the full history
          about what was done using pydocweb.

          So, "old" SVN revision as revno 0, "current" SVN rev as revno -1?

  * Refactor: the "stats" page does not always reflect the actual history,
    because the database does not contain full history. Missing information
    contains eg.:

        - The original SVN version on which the work was based:
          this messes up word counts after merging docstrings back to SVN.

          Counting word count changes in revisions is not really possible
          before this information is in the database.

        - We don't keep track of separate review history; review status
          change is always associated with a docstring revision.

        - In general, the history shown on the stats page should never change
          after the fact.

    These problems pretty much show that the "Stats" page was an afterthought...

  * Refactor: views.py has grown too long and messy; ditto for models.py

  * ..image:: directive

  * Support running plot scripts & capturing output images.

  * Fix Recent changes to show only "recent" changes
    (+ browse old changes?)

  * Sandboxing Python so that doctests producing images can be run?

  * Better merging? RCS `merge` is not so intelligent when BASE and MINE
    differ much from each other, but MINE and OTHER are quite similar.

  * Can something be done about stuff whose docstring location is not known at all?
